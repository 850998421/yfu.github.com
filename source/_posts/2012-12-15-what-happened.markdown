I just yelled and even my roommate was woken up.

What is wrong with me?! I forgot to reply to your email. I was 16 hours late. I was late for one of the tens of emails you send me everyday. And you finally got a "good" reason to abuse me. What is wrong with you?!

How many hours have I spent helping you choosing programs, revising CV and PS, checking online applications? Do you even have a slighest idea? In your mind, those things are easy to me. But, actually, they are not! It is really difficult to concentrate on everything and sometimes, I need to focus more on my things. Hopefully, I will help you till the end of your application.

I do not feel good in my throat right now. Maybe I should not yell. I should go to the gym to relax...
