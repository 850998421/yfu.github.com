我从网路上找来的(原作者不要打我!), 提供大家很好的题材..

<p>How Come<br>
A man will pay $2 for a $1 item he wants. A woman will pay $1 for a $2 item 
that she doesn't want. </p>
 
How Come<br>
A woman worries about the future until she gets a husband. A man never worries 
about the future until he gets a wife. 
 
<p>How Come<br>
A successful man is one who makes more money than his wife can spend. A 
successful woman is one who can find such a man. </p>
 
<p>How Come<br>
To be happy with a woman you must love her a lot. And not try to understand 
her at all.</p>
 
<p>How Come<br>
Married men live longer than single men. But married men are a lot more 
willing to die. </p>
 
<p>How Come<br>
Any married man should forget his mistakes. There's no use in two people 
remembering the same thing.</p>
 
<p>How Come<br>
Men wake up as good-looking as they went to bed. Women somehow deteriorate 
during the night. </p>
 
<p>How Come<br>
A woman marries a man expecting he will change, but he doesn't. A man marries 
a woman expecting that she won't change and she does. </p>
 
<p>How Come<br>
A woman has the last word in any argument. Anything a man says after that 
is the beginning of a new argument.</p>
 
<p>How Come<br>
There are two times when a man doesn't understand a woman, before marriage 
and after marriage. </p>
 
<p>How Come<br>
