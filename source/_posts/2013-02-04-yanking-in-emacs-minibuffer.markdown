This may seem a silly question but I did encounter some difficulties in yanking (pasting) things in the minibuffer in Emacs. C-y does not work and after googling online, I found that the right way is using M-y instead of C-y. The [blog](http://ignaciopp.wordpress.com/2010/12/02/emacs-how-to-paste-text-in-the-search-minibuffer/) here helped me. The author also pointed out that Richard Stallman answered the question in 2005 [here](http://www.mail-archive.com/emacs-pretest-bug@gnu.org/msg03693.html).
